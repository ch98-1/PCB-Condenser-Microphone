# PCB-Condenser-Microphone
Basic Condenser microphone kit that uses the PCB as a backplate. It is highly recommended to get the pcb manifactured with ENIG finish for flatness and corrosion resistance. For standalone use, it is recommended to go with the shielded design. For the opamp, any 8SOICopamp with the same pinout as LM358 should be able to replace the one on the board, and lower noise opamp such as OPA1678 is recommended for less static.
